An inventory website, created for the Jackson Reed robotics lab.

## Libraries

### [Bulma](https://bulma.io/)

Bulma is a CSS framework, in some ways similar to Boostrap, intended to make it easier to build the UI. The docs can be found at [bulma.io/documentation](https://bulma.io/documentation/). Bulma has no JavaScript dependencies.

### [Sortable](https://github.com/HubSpot/sortable)

Sortable is a tiny (`<2kb`) drop-in script for creating sortable tables. It doesn't have much of an API, but for what there is, there are docs at [github.hubspot.com/sortable](https://github.hubspot.com/sortable/api/options/).
